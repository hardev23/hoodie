== Pro  version ==

[Buy Pro version for $25](https://www.piwebsolution.com/product/buy-x-get-y-free-a-bogo-deal-for-woocoomerce/)

* It allows you to set the <strong>buy quantity for each product differently</strong> 

* Offer the BOGO Deal product as <strong>Free or At Discounted price</strong>

* <strong>Set free quantity</strong> differently for each product

* It allows you to offer <strong>other product as free product</strong> instead of giving the same product as free 

* You can set a <strong>message on the single product page, to describe the offer</strong>

* You can <strong>customize the message shown</strong> for each product in your own wordings

* List of short code that you can use as place holder while making offer message <strong>[free_name], [buy_quantity], [free_quantity], [free_price], [start_date_time], [end_date_time], [start_date], [end_date], [start_time], [end_time]</strong>

* You can show different parameter of the offer in the <strong>message using the short code</strong>

* Set a <strong>offer start and end time</strong>, you can set this different for each product

* Set a <strong>message that will be shown before the offer start</strong>, you can set this different for each product

* Set different <strong>message to show when the offer has started</strong>, you can set this different for each product

* Set <strong>maximum quantity of free product that can be offered</strong> with parent product.
Say 1 unit of Product A gives 1 unit of B and max quantity is 2 then, when you add 3 unit of A the quantity of Free B will be kept at 2 only as Max quantity is 2 (without max quantity restriction it would have been 3)

* Create <strong>BOGO or Buy X get Y free offer on the Category level</strong>, so you don't have to create this offer on an individual product basis

* Run category level rule on specif days of the week

* Exclude a product or a variation from a category level BOGO offer

* <strong>Overwrite the BOGO on category level with an separate rule for the product</strong> on product level rule

* You can <strong>run offer for all the variation</strong> of variable product

* Restrict the <strong>offer to run for some specific variation</strong> for a variable product

* Offer info will only show when the buyer selects a variation that has the offer, if he selects some other variation that <strong>don't have offer, the message box will disappear</strong>

* Offer <strong>different product as Free product with each of the variation</strong> in a variable product

* Show category level offer message on the respective category pages

* Give option to the customer to remove the free product from the cart (incase they don't want to receive the free product)

* If the free product is a variable product then you can allow customer to *change the variation of the free product* in the cart or on checkout page

* You can give option to the customer to select a free product from list of products, (you have to make the list of product that you will like to offer them for selection). Initially one product will be added to cart or free and will be given a option to change the free product (if you have given a list of alternate free products)

* You can make the alternate free product to be always less then the price of the product added by the customer in the cart, That is making the BOGO offer (this applied in the category based BOGO rules)

* You can control how many times a customer can avail the offer, you can set a limit on the number of time a customer can avail the offer. Say you have set the limit to 2 on the category X bogo rule, then the customer A can avail the offer only 2 times, after that the offer will not be applied for that customer A, but customer B can get the offer 2 times as well, so the limit is per customer not for all the customer. Customer A can get the benifit of the offer set on some other category B.
